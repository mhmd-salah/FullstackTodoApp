# Fullstack Todo App

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive Fullstack Todo application that I developed using a modern tech stack. The project includes both the backend and frontend components, providing a complete and scalable solution for managing tasks and to-do lists.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, improving code maintainability and scalability.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.
  - **Axios**: A popular HTTP client for making API requests from the frontend.
  - **Yup**: A schema validation library used for form validation.
  - **React Query**: A powerful data fetching and caching library for React applications.
  - **React Hook Form**: A flexible form management library that simplifies form handling.

- **Backend**:
  - **Strapi**: A headless CMS and Node.js framework used for building the backend API.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks can be assigned different priority levels to help users focus on important items.
- **Due Dates**: Tasks can be assigned due dates to help users stay on top of deadlines.
- **Task Filtering**: Users can filter tasks by status (completed, in-progress, etc.) and priority.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Secure Authentication**: Users can securely register, log in, and manage their account information.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

1. **`backend/`**: This directory contains the Strapi-based backend API, responsible for handling all data-related operations.
2. **`frontend/`**: This directory contains the React.js-based frontend application, which interacts with the backend API to provide the user interface and functionality.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, please follow the instructions provided in the project's README file. This will guide you through the setup and installation process, as well as provide information on how to start the backend and frontend components.

## Deployment

The Fullstack Todo App has been deployed to a hosting platform, making it accessible to users. You can find the live application at the following URL: [fullStackTodo.surge.sh](fullStackTodo.surge.sh)

## Conclusion

This Fullstack Todo App showcases my skills in building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I'm proud of the technologies and architectural decisions I've made to create a robust and maintainable solution. Feel free to explore the project and let me know if you have any questions or feedback!
